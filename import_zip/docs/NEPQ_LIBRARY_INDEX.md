# NEPQ Library Index (7th Level)

These assets are referenced by the generator. Keep files in `/docs/nepq/`.

Included (from your project files):
- `NEPQ_Personalized_Introduction_Cheat_Sheet.pdf`
- `NEPQ_Advanced_Win_The_Gate_Keeper_Scripts.pdf`
- `NEW-NEPQ_Black_Book_of_Diffusing_Objections.pdf`
- `NEPQ_NEPQ_Book_for_Calling_Leads.pdf`
- `NEPQ Black Book Questions (1).pdf`

## How Cursor should use them
- **Intros**: pull patterns from Personalized Intro Cheat Sheet; fill with company‑specific context.
- **Gatekeeper**: suggest responses from Gate Keeper Scripts on phone workflows.
- **Objections**: include top 3 diffusers in each cheat sheet output.
- **Discovery**: add 5–7 questions from Black Book to the 'Call Plan' section of guides.
- **Calls**: use NEPQ Book for sequencing (connect → situation → problem → implication → solution).

If PDFs are not parsed, store extracted snippets as markdown under `/docs/nepq/snippets/*.md`
and have `nepq/index.ts` return them by topic.
